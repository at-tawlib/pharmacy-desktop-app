# Pharmacy Desktop App

This is a **front-end desktop application** built with **Electron**, **React**, and **Vite**. The app simulates a pharmacy system interface, utilizing mock data with no backend integration.

## Features
- **Electron**: Desktop application framework.
- **React**: Front-end framework for building the UI.
- **Vite**: Fast development environment.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: UI components and icons.
- **Mock Data**: All data is mocked for the sake of this example.

## Getting Started

####  Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed (v14 or higher recommended).
-   **npm**: Node Package Manager comes with Node.js. Make sure it's up to date.

#### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository**:
 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/at-tawlib/pharmacy-desktop-app.git
    ```
    
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    
	```bash
	cd pharmacy-desktop-app 
	```
    
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    
    Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
	 ```bash
	npm install 
	```
	
## Running the App
1.  **Development Mode**:
    
    To run the app in development mode, where Vite will serve the React app and Electron will open a desktop window:
    
	```bash
	npm run dev
	```
    
    This will start the Electron app with live reload support.
    
2.  **Build the App**:
    
    To build the Electron app for production, run:
    ```bash
	npm run build
	```
    This will create a production-ready build of the app.
    
3.  **Preview the Build**:

    To preview the production build:
	```bash
	npm run preview
	```        
    This will open the Electron app in production mode.
    

### Running Vite Standalone

You can also run the React app alone without the Electron wrapper using Vite:

-   **Development Mode** (without Electron):
	```bash
	npm run dev-vite
	```    
-  
-  **Build the Vite App**:
	```bash
	npm run build-vite
	```    
    
-   **Preview the Vite Build**:
	```bash
	npm run preview-vite
	```

### Linting

To run ESLint to check for any code quality issues:
```bash
npm run lint
```


## Tech Stack

-   **Electron**: Desktop app framework to build cross-platform apps.
-   **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **Vite**: Next-generation front-end tooling.
-   **Material-UI (MUI)**: Component library for a great user interface.
-   **React Query**: Data-fetching and caching.
